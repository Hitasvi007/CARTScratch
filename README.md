# CART Algorithm from Scratch 🍷🚀  

Explore the foundations of decision trees with this **from-scratch implementation** of the **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** algorithm, applied to the **Wine Quality Dataset**! 🌟 This repository is perfect for those who want to:  

- 🧠 **Understand the CART Algorithm**: Learn how decision trees work, step-by-step.  
- 🍷 **Predict Wine Quality**: Use a real-world dataset to classify and predict wine quality ratings.  
- 💡 **Implement from Scratch**: Build the algorithm without relying on machine learning libraries for core logic.  

## Key Features ✨  
- Full implementation of the **CART algorithm** (split criteria, tree growth, and pruning).  
- **Support for Classification and Regression** tasks.  
- **Gini Impurity and Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as splitting criteria.  
- Easy-to-follow, well-commented code.  
- Applied to the popular **Wine Quality Dataset** for practical insights.  

## Why CART? 🤔  
CART is one of the most fundamental and powerful algorithms in machine learning. It's widely used because:  
- It builds **interpretable decision trees** for classification and regression tasks.  
- It handles both **numerical and categorical data**.  
- It forms the basis of more advanced models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.  

## About the Wine Quality Dataset 🍇  
The dataset contains physicochemical properties (like acidity, alcohol content, etc.) and corresponding quality scores (0-10) for red and white wines. It’s a popular choice for exploring regression and classification tasks in machine learning.
